                 Implicit Wait - set it 1 time and it will work for every findElement method
                    - NoSuchElementException

                 Thread.sleep - not Selenium wait! Thread = java class, sleep() method of Thread class
                                stops the execution of java program
                                - We never want to use this method in our tests

                 Explicit wait - we have to declare every time before the interaction with element
                                 Expected Condition we are looking for
